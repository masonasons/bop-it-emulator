Changes bop it menu gesture to one finger double tap.
Fixes android gesture weirdness with the two finger swipes left and right.
Makes Android speak window title updates.

Adds speech feedback to most commands.
First android build!
Puts a cap on battery capacity to prevent battery brokenness.

Fixes high score didn't properly reset, thanks Thomas Grant.
Adds speech feedback for changing mechanics.
Makes the state of mechanics save.

New in 3.1
Redesigns the saving system! Now, battery percentages as well as amount of inserted batteries saves. Also the current and in the case of the extreme, high score, saves for the current set of batteries. Note that as the extreme and original BopIts in this emulator run on the same set of batteries, when you extract a battery and reinsert it, your scores will reset.
Adds the ability to turn off mechanic sounds by pressing M.
Fixes a bug reported by Tom Grant where if you replace the batteries in your Bop It, the game would continue on at the last pitch it got to before you changed the batteries, while reporting the battery percentage as 99%.

New in 3.0
Adds the ability to put batteries in your BopIt. In fact you have to do this now in order to use your Bop It and this can be used to reset a dead battery back to 100%! Press R to insert a battery and shift R to remove one.
Fixes a bug where if you took a battery out of your BopIt while auto pilot was playing the game, you would be unable to activate any of the Bop It commands.
A lot of code cleanup/reorganization.
Fixes a glitch that could occur when in pass it mode and a round begins that would immediately cause the bop it to ask you to pass the game.
Note in readme that Turbo Mode is for both models now.
Adds mechanical sounds for performing actions in Bop It! Note. I do not have sounds for bop it mechanics for anything other than the 2002 Bop It and the Extreme, no Pen variation or 2004 Bop It, so unfortunately this is what you get but it's better than nothing!
Adjusts pull it timer in Bop It Extreme when cycling through modes.
More updates and refinements to the low battery mode!
Painstakingly redesigns, and in the case of bop it original, adds, difficulty curves. I feel the game has been way too easy for way too long. This version aims to fix that.
Adds turbo and proper quick score mode to BopIt original model, bringing it in line with the extreme as far as extra features.
Fixes a bug that meant once you started up the BopIt, the first time the game would allow you to pull it to switch through the game modes as fast as you wanted, and after playing a game, it would not. This was because some initial variables weren't being set on launch, only after a gameplay.

New in 2.5
Walks back BopIt extreme playing the winning sequence when you check your high score, as this model actually does not do that. Thanks Brandon Tyson for the confirmation!

New in 2.4
Play the winning sequence again if you twist it and you have a high score of the maximum winning score. I'm not sure if this is the correct behavior for all models, so you'll have to let me know. Thanks Tom Grant for the suggestion.

New in 2.3
Adjusts bop it pen modes to require a pull it in order to turn on the pen and makes subsequent pull its repeat "Bop it" (Thanks Acer)
Adds the joystick vibration support to the losing and score playing!
Much more robust low battery mode including more accurate timers, updating of window title after each loss of the game with the new battery level, and the availability to set battery capacity.
Updates the readme.
