Welcome to Bop It! Emulator!

This is my spin off of bop it. My goal with this was to make it as close to the original as I could mechanics-wise, while adding a few fun things here and there to make it fun.
When you launch it, you hear a voice say: "Bop it!" The first step is to put batteries in your bop it. You use the R key, or on a touch screen, two finger swipe up, to do this. Note that each of the bop its takes 3 batteries. Then, just like in the original bop it, you need to pull it to turn it on. Find the mode you want. The twist sound means beat bop and the pull sound means solo vox bop mode.
When you finish a game, while in solo, twist it to hear your score again.
New: You can either play on the 1996/2000 BopIt with the flat pull it handle, the 2004 bop it with the egg shaped pull it handle, or the original Bop It pen which only goes up to 15 points. The difference here is that the 2004 bop it has a maximum score of 200 points, as well as more stability in voice/beat playing. Press B to toggle this, or on Android, use the bop it menu, accessed by a one finger double tap.
New! Press A to activate autopilot mode! The higher twist it means it's on, the activate twist it means off. Press S to adjust the autopilot's advancedness. The highest pitch means no advancedness, the lowest means some, the second tone means more, and the third pitch means highest. On android, you can access these through the bop it menu mentioned above.
New: You can switch to a BopIt Extreme by pressing tab and back again with tab! On android, this is two finger swipe left/right

Keys:
A: Toggle AutoPilot mode.
B: Toggle bop it mode.
C: Change battery Capacity (how fast your batteries will drain, as a percentage from 1 to infinity).
S: Toggle between autopilot modes.
Q: Toggle between quick score and normal score mode. Quick score mode will play the score cipher at a much faster rate.
